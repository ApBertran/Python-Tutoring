# Python-Tutoring

This repository contains a list of program tasks along with "answer keys" for each task. The tasks range in difficulty, from beginner being for those who know absolutely nothing about python or coding in general, to advanced where the tasks will ask that you apply your python knowledge more directly. The advanced tasks comprise of anything between simple games to more complicated image processing.

Throughout all of the programs I will do my best to provide as many comments as I can explaining what all of the code does and how some functions from libraries work.
