Using `input()`, take two variables `x` and `y` and display the following math functions:
```
x + y (Addition)
x - y (Subtraction)
x * y (Multiplication)
x / y (Division)
x % y (Remainder)
```
Feel free to mess around with these math functions and explore what you can do with them. Make sure to print all sums to terminal.
